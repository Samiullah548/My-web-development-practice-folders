<!-- In CSS, the float property is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.

The clear property is used to control the behavior of elements that follow floated elements. It specifies whether an element can be positioned next to or must be moved below (cleared) any preceding floated elements.

Values for clear:

clear: left;  // The element will move below any left-floated elements.
clear: right; // The element will move below any right-floated elements.
clear: both; // The element will move below both left- and right-floated elements.
clear: none; // Default. Allows floating elements on both sides. -->
